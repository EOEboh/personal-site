Hello there, my name is Emmanuel O. Eboh, and I am a software engineer with many focus in and around web development.
I enjoy building web apps and productivity tools targeted at solving business and personal needs. Whenever I&apos;m not
coding, then I&apos;m most likely putting together my thought pieces in form of a blog article.

My leisure activities include playing basketball, watching a documentary or simply pranking Mma (laughs).
